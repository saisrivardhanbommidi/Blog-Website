            <marquee color="red">Roughly around 4:40pm, after a two-hour net session at the Dubai cricket stadium, Virat Kohli stepped into the team bus that was parked right outside the dressing room. Not far from the bus, a kid perched on his father’s shoulders let out a desperate cry: “Kohli bhaiya…please ek ticket dedo,” (please give me a ticket) drawing chuckles. Moments later, Kohli stepped out of the bus, headed towards that kid to pose for a photograph and put his signature on the kid’s cap. In a rare instance, for the next couple of minutes, Kohli would go about engaging with each of his fans before disappearing. Not just young kids, but adults have been losing their heads in admiration at his fabulous run in this tournament. Last month in Pakistan, a photo of a couple had gone viral. They were clad in jerseys in Pakistan colours but with a twist: the name and the number on the back was Virat Kohli and 18. The sales and sightings of his No.18 jersey have been tremendous, unsurprisingly.</marquee>

Known for his aggressive batting, exceptional fitness, and leadership skills, Kohli has redefined modern cricket. With numerous records to his name and a fan following that spans the globe, he is not just a cricketer but an inspiration to millions. But his journey to the top was anything but easy.
